1. Added changelog.txt to file folder
2. Added *.txt exclusion to .gitignore
3. Cleaned up legacy code from helpers
4. Cleaned a bit of whitespace here and there
5. Removed the attempts at automatic movement in simplePythonTest
6. Restructured main loop on a while clause which solved the bug with the animation not working properly
7. Moved the fill call on EKRAN inside of the inner while loop of the main() function in simplePytonTest to prevent from drawing over the previously drawed frames - not sure if that's the best fix to the problem.
8. Added spawner under key = p to test multiple Peon behaviour.

Commit nr 2 to the level-loader branch

9. Added a new levelPicker.py module -a work-in-progress module for creating pickled files with levels. Very early draft. Contains a dict for mapping object types (e.g. Peons, Projectiles, Tits) to lists of instances of class objects (e.g. Peons --> [<peon_instance_1>, <peon-instance_2>]).
10. Added Spawn() and Level_creator() claesses to classes.py for spawner objects to spawn creatures at an interval and at an position; and for creating instances of levels - only for use with the levelPickler.py module - early draft as well. The Spawner module is funcional now, though it's incredibly resource heavy and muddles the rest of the program. Might be a dead end and better off trying threading.
11. Added pickle import in the config file.
12. Changed simplePytonTest module for spawner testing.
