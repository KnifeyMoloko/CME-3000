#######################################################

1. Added changelog.txt to file folder
2. Added *.txt exclusion to .gitignore
3. Cleaned up legacy code from helpers
4. Cleaned a bit of whitespace here and there
5. Removed the attempts at automatic movement in simplePythonTest
6. Restructured main loop on a while clause which solved the bug with the animation not working properly
7. Moved the fill call on EKRAN inside of the inner while loop of the main() function in simplePytonTest to prevent from drawing over the previously drawed frames - not sure if that's the best fix to the problem.
8. Added spawner under key = p to test multiple Peon behaviour.

#########################################################

Commit nr 2 to the level-loader branch

9. Added a new levelPicker.py module -a work-in-progress module for creating pickled files with levels. Very early draft. Contains a dict for mapping object types (e.g. Peons, Projectiles, Tits) to lists of instances of class objects (e.g. Peons --> [<peon_instance_1>, <peon-instance_2>]).
10. Added Spawn() and Level_creator() claesses to classes.py for spawner objects to spawn creatures at an interval and at an position; and for creating instances of levels - only for use with the levelPickler.py module - early draft as well. The Spawner module is functional now, though it's incredibly resource heavy and muddles the rest of the program. Might be a dead end and better off trying threading.
11. Added pickle import in the config file.
12. Changed simplePytonTest module for spawner testing.

Commit nr 3 to the level-loader branch

13. Improved the random-based spawner to the point where it reliably spawns.

14. Played around with Tkinter, learned a valuable lesson: depraciated versions of libraries we work with can cause big fuckups. The only way to use PNG files with Tkinter is to use Tkinter 8.6 or higher. Which only works with Python 3.x. Installing Python 3.x with the newest Tkinter does not mean you can use that library with Python 2.7. It does however replace the old, compatible Tkinter library completely, so you're fucked and can either move to Python 3.x (and upgrade Pygame and all other used libraries accordingly), move away from PNGs or rewrite everything back.
15. Let go of Tkinter GUI/launcher idea. Moved back to rough Pygame stuff.
16. Created two new classes: Event and GUI_BUTTON:
EVENT --> planned as a event handler object - we don't really need it as an object, but will save space and readability of the testing modules and the final main module this way. Handles input from keyboard and mouse. Using that input should be handled outside of the Event class.
GUI_BUTTON --> makes GUI buttons into a template, for easy using. Pass image, position and function for the button. Lots of room for development here, including a general GUI class and using smart inheritance to share similar behavior across GUI elements.
17. Cleaned up legacy code in classes.py.

############################################################

Commit nr 4 to the level-loader branch (pushed to repo)

18. Some groundwork on the EVEN and GUI_BUTTON classes done.
19. GUI_test file created for testing of GUI elements interaction. Very vasic and buggy version.

###############################################################

Commit nr 5 to the level-loader branch (not pushed to repo)

20. Event class improved to handle quit events and mouse input (single MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and MOUSEMOTION events) - works, returns mouse position.
21. GUI_BUTTON class works, now will think of how to make it "clickable", i.e. how to check for clicks in the rect object and how to handle them.
22. GUI_test.py working without issues, may be used with different GUI elements in the future to test for display issues and I/O handling.

23. In need of testing: will the event handler capture I/O smoothly? The way it's written it captures I/O on a snapshot, point-of-time basis, which
will likely lead to problems of missed input. Probably better to put it on a while loop, but then will have to resolve the threading problem... again.

##########################################################################

Commit nr 6 to the level-loader branch (pushed to repo)

24. After a few tests the GUI_BUTTON class is clickable, i.e. it calls the get_events method of a event handler (Event class instance), checks if it's a MOUSEBUTTONDOWN type of event, if so, it executes the code passed in. Just plug in a call to the function you want to call as the third argument in the GUI_BUTTON constructor and watch the world burn.
25. Introduced slight stylistic change into the code with line breaks. Shouldn't have any apparent effect on the code execution.
26. Removed GUI objects from the Level_creator class, as GUI should be the same for every level, more or less. The GUI objects also live in the GUI_dict, similar to Peons in the Peon_list.
Next up: connecting the GUI_BUTTON functionality with the pickle loader.

############################################################################

Commit nr 7 to the level-loader branch

27. Created a new "main" file to start testing the functionality of loading levels in, having a persistent menu etc.
28. Added new_game function to helpers to define all actions that need to be taken when NewGameButton is clicked in main.
29. Added quitting function to QuitButton in main (simply plugged in quitter function to an instance of GUI_BUTTON, easy!).

Some inaccurate testing feedback: the QuitButton doesn't always register the click; you have to repeat 2-3 times to get it to work. This is likely a consequence of the EventHandler being tied to the 60 FPS clock. Think about either using a much faster clock (600 FPS) or untying it from the FPS alltogether and putting on a while loop instead (this will again bump into the problem of infitinte looping though).

##############################################################################

Commit nr 8 - to the level-loader branch

30. Pickler testing suite done in dummyPickler.py. Works like a charm with reconstructing a class instance. Some limitations have shown though:
(1) Picle seems to be a bit lost when a class creates one of it's atrributes as an instance of another class, e.g. having a 'Level' class that inits by taking a sound file and creating a pygame.mixer.Sound object out of that file. Pickle get's it's panties in a bunch over that. Gotta use filenames, object descriptors and that sort of stuff for this.
(2) Not that much of a limitation, but I'm switching to using cPickle. It's much faster. Also C language Master Race.

31. Pickler testing suite moved to the levelPickler module. Still works like a charm (tempting the coding Furies here...), now !NEU!, it checks if there is a level folder in the main game folder - if not, it creates one and dumps a level1 pickle file inside. This will need a slight rebuild once we have more than one level.
32. Changed the function of the levelPickler module - it was initially supposed to just pickle (pack into a binary text file) an instance of a level-type object that would be created by the Level_creator class. This would require the following steps to create and load in a level:

1. Create a level using the template in the Level_creator class.
2. Pickle an instance of that level using the levelPickler module.
3. Create a separate function/module/class to unpickle the level.
4. Create a separate function/module/class to "unpack" the level from the unpickled file, i.e. display the relevent elements, initiale spawners etc.

This is a very low-level way to do this and frankly I can't be bothered to create so many modules/classes that pass variables without doing anything useful.

In the new scheme we do:

1'. Create a level and pickle it using the template in levelPickler module.
2'. Pickled level files get passed by functions such as new_game for handling to the Level_creator, which does the magic of unpacking and initiating.

The only challenge here is to embed this smoothly in the main game loop. But that's the same challenge as with the previous scheme.

Commit nr 9 to the level-loader branch
Commit nr 10 to the level-loader branch (nr. 5 and 6 below)

Found a bug with cPickle. In result had to modify the Level() class in the levelPickler.py module to work around this issue. Here's the URL of the blognote
by Stefaan Lippens I used to solve the problem: <http://stefaanlippens.net/pickleproblem>.

Here's the breakdown:
1. When we first define the class Level() in the levelPickler.py module and then pickle an instance of Level() in the same module, the pickled output file
get's baked with a reference to the name of the parent module. Since we're opening levelPickler.py as a standalone (sorta) level editing app, it get's opened
with the name: __main__.
2. When we try to unpickle the level, cPickle reads the name of the parent module for the file. It then proceeds to try to define the class that's the prototype
for the pickled instance*.
3. cPickle looks for the definition of the class type Level() in the module named __main__, but that name is now used by a different module (our own main.py,
that was designed specifically to be treated as the __main__ in all circumstances). It therefore finds no attribute of __main__ equal to Level() and throws
a AttributeError.
4. The solution is to force cPickle to define the __module__ variable for Level() as equal to levelPickler.py. Stefaan Lippens code was used for this. Mad props
for the guy.
5. Another thing to note: using the 'protocole = -1' arg when pickling threw another fun error:
"Can't pickle levelPickler.Level: it's not the same object as levelPickler.Level"
Deleteing the forced protocole argument solved the issue though.
6. EDIT: NOT QUITE. Deleting the protocole arg makes cPickle save instances in ASCII format and that goes well enough. But trying to use the higher protocoles
causes the error mentioned in 5 above. The cause of this is: Level ostensibly has a __module__ parameter equal to it's file name, but the instance of Level is
created by __main__, so Pickle get's confused - what it's trying to serialize is different from what it has in it's memory. The two objects are not equal, so
it fails some internal check of Pickle. The only way around that, as far as I know is to call levelPickler from another module. At this point it would probably
make more sense to simply throw the Level class into classes.py, but that would defeat the design of levelPickler and create a messy class definition. I'd rather
have a clunky two-module thingy for creating levels.

*(In a way this gives insight into how Pickle and cPickle work. To allow the instances of the class object to be created with a dynamic scope, e.g. different
parameters and args, it needs to use the class definition every time to dynamically create objects from the pickled data. In essence, Pickle 'quietly' imports
the class definition, plugs the pickled data and recreates the instance in the stack. It's not so much a freezer for class instances as a fast lane for recreating
instances of class objects, with less memory overhead.)

Commit nr 11 to the branch level-loader

1. Debugged the sound loading. Must use PCM .wav files if using .wav at all. I used Audacity to reformat the .wav.
2. Background music playing well enough, seperate methods used for stopping playback and volume adjustment.

##############################################################################

Commit nr 12 to the branch level-loader

1. Rebuilt the Spawn() class as a child of pygame.sprite.Sprite class. This is to allow the update() method to be
called on each frame. We will only call the update() function, not the draw() function.
2. Removed the spawn_spawners method from the Level_creator class, as it's been
rebranded as the update() method.

Issue analysis:
- it looks as if the activate_spawners() method doesn't work, while a simple external for loop assigning the
self.active attribute does the job
- TO DO: compare the way activate_spawners() works through debug logs vs. the for loop done in external fashion

##############################################################################

Commit nr 13 to the branch level-loader

Fixed the activate_spawners() method to actually change the  active flag in the
spawners. Important note: to do so, I had to make the method reference an
external module holding the class instances - in this case: config.Object_list.
This is because the actual class instance we want to manipulate lives as a
member of the Sprite group in config.Object_list. Changing the self.spawners
active flag, even though intuitively correct, changes nothing in the instance
living in the config module. This will likely translate to behaviors of other
classes and methods as well, especially the deactivate method for spawners.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 14 to the branch level-loader

- Aligned the rest of the methods in the Level_creator class with the
activate_spawners() method
- Code housecleaning: cleaned debug print statements from the code
- Recoded the get_spawner_attr() mehtod in Spawn class and the
get_spawners() method in Level_creator class for a cleaner output
- Code housecleaning: erased the key input handling from Event class
- Made Peon.direction attribute a random binary choice (left, right)
- added a get_peons() function description in the helpers module for no clear
reason
- added a empty() call to the GUI_list group in new_game(), so we don't have
menu button rects messing up the interaction in a level
- Code housekeeping: moved the pygame.mixer.init() to the config module inits
- File housekeeping: removed .pyc files, deleted the dummy_testing template

##############################################################################

Commit nr 15 - importing the physics_collider branch into a new, more up to date
"physics" branch

1. Created physics_test.py file: no GUI buttons; reinstated the testing behavior
 of the random Spawner.
3. Goal: create a simple "if collide with X - change direction" mechanic for the
Peons. Sub-goal: Peons shoud bounce off of static objects, like scenery. The
scenery elements should stay in place.
4. Added some a handy wall_size variable in config to play around with walls.
5. Added some code in physics_test.py to create wall arrays covering the sides
of the screen. These can be used for collision / physics testing. A for() loop
is introduced to automate the wall array creation.
6. The Enviroment_Wall class is now ready to be used for collision testing. The
important thing is to use the self.mass attribute for collision calcs.
7. Self.mass attribute added to Peon class.
8. Now to get some of that good old Newton on on on on.


##############################################################################

Commit nr 16 - physics branch

1. Changed the Spawner class definition. Now Spawners are being added both to
the Object_list and to the Spawner_list - this is to have a safe option for
wokring with the Spawner objects, which need not be drawn, moved etc.
2. Added the respective group: Spawner_list to the config file.
3. Changed physics_test.py to be more in line with main.py by removing the draw
call for the Object_list group.
4. Added Enviro_list as a group in config.py and switched the group that all
Environment_Wall objects are assigned to. Added a draw call to that one in the
physics_test.py file.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 17 - physics branch

1. Removed Spawners from the Object_list; they are still part of the
Spawner_list. This is to allow for calling the collider function on all objects
in the Object_list with one call instead of looping through some temp lists.
2. Changed the collision to work on Enviro_list objects vs. Peon_list. Note:
this is pretty lousy.
3. Plan: introduce the collision check as two-phase: (1) Check for collisions
between all objects present on the canvas; (2) delegate any behavior changes
to the classes themselves.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 18 -physics branch

1. Built a simple collision check between Enviro_list (walls basically) and
the Peon_list. The Peon_list element is hardcoded in the helpers file, which
is subject to change. The function prints the object tha collided with a wall.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 19 -physics branch - Group collision checks!

1. Added walls to the Object_list in the Environment_Wall class definition for
working with collision check.
2. Started defining the collision check mechanic in the Event class definition.
The rationale for this is: we can treat collisions as a defined event type and
use the Event class as the handler of these events. The core calculations and
logic deciding what happens after the collision can be delegated to helper
functions for readability.
3. Using groupcollide() method of the pygame.sprite class, added two collision
checks that act on Peon_list X Enviro_list and Peon_list X Head_list, producing
peon_enviro_collisions and peon_head_collisions - two dicts that will pair the
collided objects.
4. Next up: making the peons change direction after a colliding event with a
wall.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 20 -physics branch - mirror-bounce

1. Add self.vector property to Peon class as a 2-D vector (basiaclly a 2-tuple).
2. Rewrite the update() methon in Peon to work with self.vector.
3. Remove mass attribute from Peon clas. We can do massless physics. Photon
physics basically.
4. Added some randomized behavior to the Peon class, to make it randomly change
direction or stop.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 21 -physics branch - mirror-bounce ctd.

1. TO DO: for every instance of the Peon class found in the relevant collision
dict, have their self.vector[0] element be multiplied by -1 to make them change
direction without speed.
2. TO DO: play around with slightly diminishing the speed of the Peon after a
collision.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 22 - physics branch - mirror-bounce ctd.

1. COMPLETED: for every instance of the Peon class found in the relevant collision
dict their self.vector[0] element is multiplied by -1 to make them change
direction without speed.
2. TO DO: play around with slightly diminishing the speed of the Peon after a
collision.

###############################################################################

Commit nr 23 - master branch - updates, cleanups and realignment

1. Changed the Level_creator class to activate the spawners by scanning
config.Spawner_list and sidestepping checking the type of object (i.e.
is it a Spawn-class object) for activation/deactivation of spawners.
2.Added a call to Spawner_list.update() to the calls in the main loop in
main.py.
3. Added the wall array construction loop to main.py for collisions.
4. Added calls to the collision getter and the collision processor in
in the Event class to the main loop.
5. Added the .idea folder to .gitignore so we don't overwrite each others
PyCharm settings.
