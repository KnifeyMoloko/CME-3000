###Pre-Alpha Minus One Fellatio On Your Father Version

This small project is meant to blow minds and reshape the universe. Besides that it is a training project for us. We have some resources and graphical assests (Thom fapped them out, thanks!) plus some code in Python to start our work with. The game could be done in Game Maker or Unity, but that would take a lot of the fundamentals out of the project, so right now we're sticking to Python 2.7.6

The first slice of the game will have the following characteristics:
* game code written in Pyton 2.7.6
* modular code architecture i.e. separate modules for classes, helper functions, config - this is a bitch to work with, but has a few upsides e.g. we can re-use the modules in other projects without cutting out large parts of code from a master file
* two initial classes: the Peon and the Head
* simple randomised behaviour for the Peon - essentially walking randomly
* simple keyboard controlled behaviour for the Head
* a basic interaction for the Peon being eaten

###Optional features:
- a gridline for the Peon to walk on
- some simple collision mechanic i.e. bouncing the Peon of the border of the screen
- simple sounds
- music background
- just testing here if I'm doing anything......
